Trading Bot

Here's a detailed explanation of the provided Python script that implements a trading bot using the Alpaca API:

---

## Overview

This script is designed to analyze options for specified stock symbols, identify profitable trading opportunities, place orders, and exercise options through the Alpaca API. The bot continuously monitors the market and executes trades automatically based on the opportunities it finds.

### Key Components

The script is composed of several classes, each handling specific responsibilities:

1. **AlpacaAPI**: Handles communication with the Alpaca API, including fetching options data, current stock prices, and checking the market clock.
2. **ContractInfo**: Manages the details of options contracts and formats option symbols.
3. **OptionAnalyzer**: Analyzes options data to identify profitable trading opportunities.
4. **OrderManager**: Handles placing orders and exercising options.
5. **TradingBot**: The main class that orchestrates the trading activities by continuously analyzing options and executing trades.

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. `AlpacaAPI` Class

This class manages the interaction with the Alpaca API by sending HTTP requests to fetch data needed for trading decisions.

- **`__init__(self, api_key, secret_key)`**: Initializes the API credentials and sets up the HTTP headers for authentication.
  
- **`get_options_data(self, url)`**: Sends a GET request to fetch options data from the given URL. Returns the data in JSON format if the request is successful.

- **`get_current_prices(self, url)`**: Fetches the current stock prices from the given URL. Returns the data in JSON format if the request is successful.

- **`get_market_clock(self)`**: Retrieves the current market clock, which indicates whether the market is open or closed.

#### 2. `ContractInfo` Class

This class manages the information related to options contracts and formats the symbols for easier identification.

- **`__init__(self, alpaca_api)`**: Initializes the class with an instance of the `AlpacaAPI` class to fetch contract data.

- **`get_contract_data(self, symbol)`**: Retrieves the details of a specific option contract based on its symbol.

- **`format_symbol(self, data)`**: Formats the option symbol using the contract data, including expiration date, root symbol, option type, and strike price. This formatted symbol is used to identify the option uniquely.

#### 3. `OptionAnalyzer` Class

This class is responsible for analyzing available options and identifying those that offer profitable opportunities.

- **`__init__(self, alpaca_api, contract_info)`**: Initializes the class with instances of `AlpacaAPI` and `ContractInfo` to retrieve and format option data.

- **`calculate_profit(self, strike_price, ask_price, stock_price)`**: Calculates the potential profit from an option based on the strike price, ask price, and current stock price.

- **`analyze_options(self, symbol)`**: Analyzes the available options for a given stock symbol by fetching options data and current stock prices. It uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process multiple options concurrently for efficiency. Profitable opportunities are stored in the `self.opportunities` list.

- **`get_contract_details_and_format(self, option_symbol, ask_price, bid_price)`**: Fetches contract details and formats the option symbol using the `ContractInfo` class. This method is used by the `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent processing.

#### 4. `OrderManager` Class

This class manages the placement of orders and the exercising of options.

- **`__init__(self, alpaca_api)`**: Initializes the class with an instance of `AlpacaAPI` to place orders.

- **`place_order(self, symbol, qty, limit_price)`**: Places a limit order for a specific stock or option. It sends a POST request to the Alpaca API with the order details.

- **`exercise_option(self, option_symbol)`**: Exercises an option by sending a request to the Alpaca API. This is used when the bot decides to execute an option contract.

#### 5. `TradingBot` Class

This is the main class that runs the trading bot. It continuously analyzes options for specified stock symbols, identifies opportunities, and executes trades.

- **`__init__(self, symbols)`**: Initializes the trading bot with a list of stock symbols to monitor. It creates instances of `AlpacaAPI`, `ContractInfo`, `OptionAnalyzer`, and `OrderManager`.

- **`run(self)`**: The main loop that continuously analyzes options and executes trades. For each symbol in `self.symbols`, it:
  1. Analyzes options using `OptionAnalyzer`.
  2. Places orders for the stock and options if profitable opportunities are found.
  3. Spawns a new thread to exercise the options after a 30-second delay.
  4. Clears the console and displays the current opportunities.

- **`clear_console(self)`**: Clears the console output for a clean display of current opportunities.

- **`display_opportunities(self, symbol)`**: Displays the list of identified opportunities in a formatted manner.

- **`delayed_exercise(self, option_symbol)`**: Delays the exercise of an option by 30 seconds to simulate real-world trading scenarios.

#### Main Execution

- **`if __name__ == "__main__":`**: This block serves as the entry point for the script. It initializes the `TradingBot` with a list of symbols (in this case, "GME") and starts the bot by calling the `run` method.

### Summary

This script is a sophisticated trading bot designed to operate in an automated fashion. It continuously monitors the market for profitable options trading opportunities, places orders, and exercises options as needed. The use of multithreading and concurrent processing ensures that the bot operates efficiently, even when handling a large number of options contracts.

### Notes:

- The script is tailored to work with the Alpaca API, so the appropriate API credentials are required.
- The bot operates in a continuous loop (`while True:`), so it will keep running until manually stopped.
- The script assumes that the market is open and that the data fetched is up-to-date. Ensure the Alpaca API's market clock is used to verify market status if needed.
